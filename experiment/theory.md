C is a general purpose procedural programming language. With the help of this experiment students can understand the concept of Arithmetic operators and also apply this on other program. To calculate area and circumference of a circle, we need an input parameter (radius). User enter input and simulator will generate result.
<br>
To calculate area of a circle we use formula ->3.14 * r * r
<br>
And to calculate circumference of a circle formula is -> 2 * 3.14 *r
