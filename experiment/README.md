### Aim
To understand the basic concept of C programming and how to calculate area and circumference of a circle.
### Theory
C is a general purpose procedural programming language. With the help of this experiment students can understand the concept of Arithmetic operators and also apply this on other program. To calculate area and circumference of a circle, we need an input parameter (radius). User enter input and simulator will generate result.

To calculate area of a circle we use formula 3.14 * r * r

And to calculate circumference of a circle formula is  2 * 3.14 *r

### Procedure
a) For area of a circle
Step 1:Start
Step 2:Readradius of circle
Step 3:Calculatearea using formula, area= 3.14 * r * r
Step 4:Printarea
Step 5:Stop
b) For circumference of a circle
Step 1:Start
Step 2:Read radius of circle
Step 3:Calculate circumference of a circle using formula, circumference =   2* 3.14 * r 
Step 4:Printcircumference.
Step 5:Stop

### Pre Test
Q1. C program compilation start from main function.
•	True
•	FalseAns:- True
Q2. A C program can have more than one main function.
•	True
•	FalseAns :- False
Q3. To calculate the area of a circle, we need to multiply radius two times.
•	True
•	FalseAns :- True
Q4. Circumference means distance around the edge of a circle.
•	True
•	FalseAns :- True
Q5. Circumference is a type of perimeter.
•	True
•	FalseAns :- True
